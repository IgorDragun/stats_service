## Stats Service

### Short description.

It is a service that I developed using only Ruby (without any major framework) to improve my understandig of the language, specifically how such applications can interact with other applications.

This service is related to https://github.com/IgorDragun/my_api, which is an API application that sends data of bought items.

This service retrieves the data, processes it, and saves it separately for each user.
